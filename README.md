The purpose of this repository is primarily for providing a cloud-based-signature update database. This way it will be much easier for us to hotpatch Telegram version updates without requiring to reinject or download a new DLL everytime BetterTelegram is launched.

As an addition to providing coud-based-signature updates, this repository will serve as a doxygen for explanation of each hook/signature that BetterTelegram takes advantage of.
